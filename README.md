Fraud detection is not a modeling problem — it is a decision-making problem under extreme imbalance.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end, production-oriented machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, focusing on engineering choices, evaluation correctness, and business risk optimization.

🔥 Why This Project Matters

Fraud transactions are < 0.2% of all data

Accuracy is misleading

Missing fraud is financially expensive

Real systems care about recall, cost, and explainability, not leaderboard scores

This repository shows how fraud detection is actually done in the real world.

🧠 Problem Definition

We model fraud detection as a binary classification problem:

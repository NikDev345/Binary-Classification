🚨 Credit Card Fraud Detection
Binary Classification | Imbalanced Learning | Business-Driven ML
<p align="center"> <img src="images/image.webp" alt="Fraud Detection Banner" width="50%"> </p>

Fraud detection is not a modeling problem — it is a decision-making problem under extreme imbalance.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end, production-oriented machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, focusing on engineering choices, evaluation correctness, and business risk optimization.

🔥 Why This Project Matters

Fraud transactions are < 0.2% of all data

Accuracy is misleading

Missing fraud is financially expensive

Real systems care about recall, cost, and explainability, not leaderboard scores

This repository shows how fraud detection is actually done in the real world.

🧠 Problem Definition

We model fraud detection as a binary classification problem:
| Label | Meaning                |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| `0`   | Legitimate Transaction |
| `1`   | Fraudulent Transaction |

📊 Dataset Overview (Numerical Transactions)

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Source: Kaggle

File: creditcard.csv

Total Transactions: ~284,807

Fraud Cases: ~492

🔍 Features

V1 → V28: PCA-transformed anonymized features

Amount: Transaction value

Class: Target label

⚠️ Severe class imbalance (<0.2%) makes this dataset realistic and dangerous.


🧩 Core Challenges Addressed

✔ Extreme class imbalance
✔ Hardware & performance constraints
✔ Metric selection beyond accuracy
✔ Probability calibration
✔ Business-aware thresholding
✔ Model explainability (SHAP)

🤖 Models Implemented
1️⃣ Logistic Regression (Baseline)

Trained on original imbalanced data

Demonstrates why accuracy fails

📉 Result:
✔ High accuracy
❌ Almost zero fraud recall

2️⃣ Logistic Regression + SMOTE

Uses Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique

Balances learning without touching test data

📈 Result:
✔ Significant recall improvement
✔ Better minority-class learning

3️⃣ 🚀 XGBoost (Industry-Grade Model)

Implemented in xg_boost.py

✔ Captures non-linear fraud patterns
✔ Uses scale_pos_weight for imbalance
✔ Optimized using PR-AUC, not accuracy

📊 Outcome:

Best precision–recall tradeoff

Production-ready behavior

📈 Evaluation Metrics (Chosen on Purpose)

Accuracy is not used for decision-making.

| Metric    | Why It Matters                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Precision | Avoid blocking legit users     |
| Recall    | Catch fraud (highest priority) |
| F1-Score  | Balance precision & recall     |
| ROC-AUC   | Ranking quality                |
| PR-AUC    | True performance on imbalance  |

🧠 Probability Calibration & Business Thresholding

Instead of using the default 0.5 threshold:

✔ Model probabilities are calibrated
✔ Precision–Recall curve is analyzed
✔ F1-optimal & cost-aware threshold is selected

🧮 Cost Matrix Logic

❌ False Negative (Missed Fraud) → High Cost

⚠ False Positive (Blocked Legit) → Lower Cost

This aligns predictions with financial reality, not math purity.

🔍 Explainability with SHAP

✔ Feature-level contribution analysis
✔ Transaction-level decision explanation
✔ Required for banking & regulatory trust

This makes the model auditable, not a black box.
